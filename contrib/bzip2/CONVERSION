1. Move the code we want to isolate to its own compilation unit. This
   is so we can use compile-time errors to detect any interactions
   with the rest of the code.

   In this case, we want to wrap the code that interacts with the
   compression and decompression library. A visual inspection shows
   that this is just the functions compressStream(),
   uncompressStream() and testStream().
