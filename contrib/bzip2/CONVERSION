1. Move the code we want to isolate to its own compilation unit. This
   is so we can use compile-time errors to detect any interactions
   with the rest of the code.

   In this case, we want to wrap the code that interacts with the
   compression and decompression library. A visual inspection shows
   that this is just the functions compressStream(),
   uncompressStream() and testStream().

2. Compile.

   Obviously we will now get errors because of the missing
   functions. Add them to an appropriate new header.
